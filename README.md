# OOP-Project-Escape-the-room.
This was my first experience with objects. In this project we were given free rein to create whatever we wanted as long as it was text based.
I thought creating an escape the room game would be fun.

This game has a 3 room tutorial that will teach the player what kind of puzzles will be in the game. 
Once the player is in the actual game the game will create random puzzles with random furniture in the room.
The player can choose how many rooms they wish to try to escape and they can decide if they would like to play the tutorial or not.
There is some ascii art to make it a little more fun.
